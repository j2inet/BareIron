# A Derivitive Work Based on the Efforts of [p2r3](https://github.com/p2r3)'s project [bareiron](https://github.com/p2r3/bareiron)

* Taken from commit [6a65b8a](https://github.com/p2r3/bareiron/commit/6a65b8acba6d8dc6aebdf08469f6b4729e0fcf77)

First, I want to give credit to the person to which it is owed. This repository is based on the work of p2r3 and his efforts to host a minimalistic minecraft server on an embedded device. I came across his video when I was looking for some information on the protocol that Mincraft uses for its server. I thought his work made for a very practical start to get up-and-running ASAP. If you stumbled upon this repository first, please show appreciation to him.
